# AI-Based Grievance Redressal System 🚀  
**Hackathon Round 2 Submission**

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Public grievance platforms such as **CPGRAMS** receive a very large number of complaints every day.  
Most of these complaints are **manually reviewed, classified, and prioritized**, which results in:

- Delays in grievance resolution  
- High workload on government officials  
- Poor handling of urgent and critical complaints  

An automated, intelligent system is required to improve efficiency and transparency.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This project presents an **AI-Based Grievance Redressal System** that uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to automate grievance handling.

The system:
- Automatically classifies complaints into departments  
- Predicts priority using sentiment and urgency  
- Provides complaint status updates via an AI chatbot  

This reduces manual effort and ensures faster resolution of grievances.
