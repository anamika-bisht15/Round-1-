## Future Growth & Extended Capabilities

To ensure the AI-Based Grievance Redressal System remains effective as the user base grows and technology evolves, we have planned the following enhancements:

1. Multilingual Support (Inclusivity)
- Expansion: We plan to integrate a translation layer (using Google Translate API or custom fine-tuned models) to accept grievances in regional languages like Hindi, Bengali, or Marathi.
- Impact: This ensures the platform is accessible to a wider demographic who may not be comfortable reporting issues in English.

2. Predictive Analytics for Infrastructure
- Proactive Maintenance: By analyzing historical grievance data, the system will identify "Hotspots"—areas with frequent recurring issues (e.g., constant water leakage in a specific zone).
- Government Dashboards: We will build a heat-map dashboard for officials to visualize problem areas, allowing them to fix root causes before new complaints are even filed.

3. Automated Resolution Verification
- Image Recognition: Users will be able to upload "After" photos of a fixed issue.
- AI Validation: Our computer vision model will compare the "Before" (complaint) and "After" (resolution) images to automatically verify if the work was completed satisfactorily before closing the ticket.
